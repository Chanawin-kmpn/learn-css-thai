## Web Stack Overview

The website architecture prioritizes performance, interactivity, and content management. The component-based structure allows for consistent design patterns and reusable elements throughout the site. Server-side rendering capabilities ensure fast initial page loads and improved SEO, while client-side interactivity enhances the learning experience. The content management approach using MDX enables writers to create rich, interactive tutorials without extensive technical knowledge of HTML.
